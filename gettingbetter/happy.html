          <p>I am a fan of the song <em>Happy</em> by Pharrell Williams.</p>

          <p>Let me repeat that. I think <em>Happy</em> by Pharrell is a good song.</p>

          <p>When I hear <em>Happy</em> by Pharrell, I want to get up, dance, sing, and all-around just feel myself.</p>

          <p>And I don’t give a fuck what you think about me for that.</p>

          <p>I do understand why people would have distaste for an overplayed song such as Happy. I’ve had similar axes to grind over the years, whether it was with Baby, Despacito, or any other number ones that shed a light on the short fuse of the listening public.</p>

          <p>However, my first gripe is that I believe Happy is simply better than a lot of those songs. The production is lush, intriguing, and infectious, all at the same time. Lots of chart-toppers can be fairly monotonous and one-note, not to mention incredibly noisy, all at the same time. Happy is none of those things. Most number ones are bangers or ballads. Pharrell made it to the top with a soft bop. That’s no easy feat.</p>

          <p>In the grand scheme of things, though, I find myself frustrated that people seem to lose sight of how difficult it is to make a hit. Think, for a moment, about just how much music there is on Spotify. Sure, you have Dua Lipa, The Weeknd, Ariana Grande, anything and everything that is massively popular. Or you could be a very genre-specific listener. You listen to Thomas Rhett and other country artists. Maybe you’re a hip hop-head and you binge Wu Tang records all day. These kinds of artists don’t have a hold in the mainstream, but are still quite popular. Maybe you like some alternative music. Does The Head and The Heart strike your fancy? Sure, they’re not as big as the arena-size artists we just mentioned, but they still have a broad appeal. Or you might be into classic rock. Or jazz. Whatever. The point is, there is a range of music in your mind which is either good, relevant, or popular enough for you to have been made aware of it. Now think about how much music there is on Spotify beyond what you know.</p>

          <p>Want the answer? It’s over 50 million songs. That’s an absolute fuckload of music.</p>

          <p>Can you imagine what it takes to cut through the noise? It’s incredible to have had even one song on the Billboard charts. Pharrell, though, has charted numerous songs and albums, whether they were his own, those he made with his group N.E.R.D., or work which he produced for other artists. His talents have been tested in many different settings, yet again and again, he has found a huge audience. Granted, it is easier to sustain success after that initial hit, but the level of prominence Pharrell has enjoyed over the years? It’s incredibly uncommon. He has enjoyed mainstream success for almost two decades now. There are very few artists who you can say the same about. You can probably count them on two hands, although I’d honestly challenge you to get past one.</p>

          <p>Here’s my point: you’re not smarter or better than anyone because you don’t like something for the sole reason of it being popular. It actually makes you seem kind of oblivious. If you truly like music and claim to appreciate songcraft, you would at the very least acknowledge the legitimacy of music that is popular and what it takes to get to that point. Yes, it’s probably enriching to dig deeper beyond what’s on the radio, but there’s nothing cool about not having your finger on the pulse, either. Real music fans grow to appreciate the best of both worlds. But maybe that’s just me.</p>
