      <p>Hi! My name is Patrick Meyer. I'm a musician in a very general sense-I sing some, play guitar, and I'm starting to learn how to produce. This site is here for me to share content from my progress, whether that be stories, clips, or tips. Hit one of the links below to check out some of my stuff.</p>
