        <div class='article-subtitle'><h4>The sixth LP from hip hop's favorite boy band blends emotional sentiment and danceability, often simultaneously.</h4></div>
        <div class='article-content'>

          <p>If you’re not familiar with alt-hip hop Reddit heartthrobs Brockhampton yet, well, there’s a lot to explain. A 13-member self-professed “boy band”, Brockhampton is composed of vocalists, producers, creative directors, filmmakers, photographers, you name it. At the group’s center are the seven vocalists: Matt Champion, Joba, Jabari Manwa, Merlyn Wood, Dom McLennon, Bearface, and their collective leader, Kevin Abstract. Originally formed in Texas in the early 2010s, the group’s members are all over the spectrum of race, sexuality, and even geographic origin. While many of the members went to high school together in Woodlands, Texas , the rest met the core members over the internet; McLennon is from Connecticut, and Bearface (real name Ciarán McDonald) hails from Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>After going through a rough couple of years, including the ousting of original member Ameer Vann over sexual assault allegations, scrapping new material due to this and leaks, a hiatus, and a polarizing last couple of releases, fans eagerly awaited this project, which has been teased for nearly a year.</p>

          <p>The album opens with headbanging single Buzzcut, featuring the eccentric yet remarkably consistent Danny Brown. It becomes evident on this track that this album will not be made up simply of posse cut moshers, with each core member throwing in a verse, a formula rehashed (don’t get me wrong, very effectively) on previous projects. Instead, Brockhampton desaturates (no pun intended) the quantity of members on most tracks, a shift in formula that is largely successful. Performers are slotted in alongside guest features, also a new frontier for the group (the list of prominently featured non-members on past albums includes half of a hook from Jaden Smith, an interlude from UK MC Slowthai, and a few verses and hooks from former YouTuber/Disney star Ryan Beatty, reborn as basically the group’s unofficial 14th member). The flavors don’t overpower each other. A teaspoon of Merlyn alongside A$AP Rocky and SoGoneSoFlexy on Count on Me, a track that harkens back to Ginger, the group’s previous release. Joba is given more room in the spotlight than ever before on The Light and delivers a heart wrenching verse about his father’s recent suicide over a riveting Wu-Tang influenced beat.</p>

          <p>In addition to poignant emotional moments, there’s no shortage of fun to be had on this record. I can’t wait to blast Count on Me in my car with the windows down come summer, and G-Funk heavy hitter Don’t Shoot Up The Party is evocative of the greatest hip hop artists’ ability to blend conscious lyrics with club-ready music.</p>

          <p>The album is maybe the group’s most well-balanced yet. Where their first four releases were banger-heavy, and 2019’s Ginger almost shockingly sappy, it seems as if the Brockhampton boys have found a way to incorporate the best of both worlds on this record. That being said, it does seem at times if they have trouble sequencing those states of mind into a cohesive tracklist. We only settle into a flow around The Light, before which point the tracks feel somewhat disjointed. However, there’s very rarely a dud on the album, and it contains many of what are sure to be known as the group’s best tracks, in addition to plenty of other memorable and thoroughly enjoyable material. Both the group’s most accessible and emotional album to date, it would be a real shame if they chose to hang it up after their next LP, per their stated intention. It’s important to note that they have declared an impending break up multiple times in the past. These boys are close and create magic together, and I have a really hard time believing they’ll stop making music together, whether under the Brockhampton name or not, anytime soon.</p>

          <p>I’m giving Brockhampton’s ROADRUNNER: NEW LIGHT, NEW MACHINE a 9/10 for stellar production, heartfelt and entertaining work from the group’s MCs, clear growth and improvement from their previous records, and an impressive mixture of alternative, classic, and mainstream hip hop/R&B influences.</p>
