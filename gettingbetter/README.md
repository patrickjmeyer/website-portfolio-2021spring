Hi! Welcome to my Website Portfolio project, "Getting Better". It's a site meant to show miscellaneous aspects of my musical work (hence the scrapbook subtitle). Here's a rundown of things I still need to work on:

-Original content (Enjoy the Run the Jewels placeholder. If you haven't heard of Run the Jewels, you now have homework. Change that.) Mostly gonna be covers and some drafts of beats/song demos, as well as a couple blog posts on musical topics I feel strongly about.
-Spacing/padding. I can't seem to get any of this padding stuff to work, so I look forward to asking a million dumb questions about it in studio on Thursday. For now, though, everything looks a little smushed.
-Header font is rendering weird and I don't know why. Will either successfully troubleshoot this or change it altogether.

Otherwise, what you're seeing should give you a pretty good idea of where I'm at. Criticism and advice is welcome. Thanks!
