Hi! Welcome to my Website Portfolio project, "Getting Better". It's a site meant to show miscellaneous aspects of my musical work (hence the scrapbook subtitle). Some (most) of it is rough, some of it is more polished, some of it is not actual music and is just me writing about other people's music! I hope you find at least a minute or two's worth of smiles, head bobs, or some form of enjoyment from this.
